SUPERCLICKER

This program is a click counter. When you open it, you see a number starting at 0 and two buttons:

"click me" – Each time you press this, the number goes up by 1.

"reset" – This sets the number back to 0.

It’s a simple way to count things, like how many times you press a button.

8 BALL

This program is like a Magic 8 Ball toy. You type a yes/no question (like "Will I pass my test?") and press the "Ask the 8 Ball" button. It gives you a random answer, such as:

"Yes" (in green)

"No" (in red)

"Maybe" (in orange)

Other fun answers

If you don’t type anything, it tells you to "ask a question".

WHAT I LEARNED

Buttons can do things when clicked, like adding to a number or giving a random answer.

You can change colors and styles to make the app look nicer.

Programs can check if you typed something before giving an answer.
